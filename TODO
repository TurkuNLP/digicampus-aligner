1) Test with real data
- [done] remove the document itself as the return
- [done] would be nice to show the document IDs for the returned documents
- [done] if another tab is opened, another set of data is uploaded, then the new data go to the old tab as well
- [cannot fix] sentence segmentation: 'mm.' got broken down into two sentences
- observation: high precision, low recall
- tfidf-vectorizer from parsebank gave worse results on the tilinpäätös data, turned off atm

2) I think it would be good to try with euclidean distance but maybe it's not necessary

Tested.

3) API needs to be documented

TODO
- documentation in `api_doc.md`, possibly needs some improvement/rewrite

4) Document similarity matrix (doc_sim_matrix_tfidf and/or margin_doc_sim) should be exposed in the API
    4.1)   The structure returned by query_by_doc_id and query_tfidf should be exposed as json
[done]

5) Segmentation would be good to return in terms of character offsets (needs back-align to source text after udpipe)

only if time

6) udpipe is not thread-safe, some solution is missing

TODO

7) calls in API should be wrapped into try .. except so the application does not die on bad input

[done]

8) method and threshold could be made parameters of the launch script through env variables
[done]

9) query by text is right now probably broken
[fixed]
