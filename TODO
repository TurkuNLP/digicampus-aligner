1) Test with real data

2) I think it would be good to try with euclidean distance but maybe it's not necessary

3) API needs to be documented

4) Document similarity matrix (doc_sim_matrix_tfidf and/or margin_doc_sim) should be exposed in the API

   The structure returned by query_by_doc_id and query_tfidf should be exposed as json

5) Segmentation would be good to return in terms of character offsets (needs back-align to source text after udpipe)

6) udpipe is not thread-safe, some solution is missing

7) calls in API should be wrapped into try .. except so the application does not die on bad input
